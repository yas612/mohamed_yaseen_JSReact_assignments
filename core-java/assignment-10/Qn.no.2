1.you can't use local variable type interface with argument methods,

public long count(var fileList)
var cannot be used for fields, method parameters,and method return types.
the reason is that type in these locations appear explicitly in class files and javadoc specifications.
with type interface, it's quite easy for a change to an initializer to cause the variable inferred to change.

2.you can't initialize a var variable to null

var count=null;
by assuming null,it is not clear what the type should be, since in java any object ref can be null.

3.we can't use local variable type interface with lamda exp

var z=() -> {} 
reason behind this is because those require an explicit target type.
